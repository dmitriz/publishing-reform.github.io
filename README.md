# [Public Discussion on Publishing Reform](https://gitlab.com/publishing-reform/discussion/issues)

## Our vision
Our goal is to simultaneously open scholarly publishing to the society and 
raise the standards by making it fairer, more efficient and productive for the researchers.
We would like to maximize everyone's efforts and save everyone's time, 
including members of this project.

## What makes this forum different?
There are many Question and Answer boards on this and related topics.
We see this forum as Collaborative Action Group aiming to differ in its focus:
- Focus on concrete tangible actions towards the cause.
- Identifying and dispelling concerns standing in the way of action.
- Creating community backed public documents.
- Reporting on every progress made.


## What are the challenges?
A major challenge right now is 
to have the academic community agree on the 
**seriousness of the harm** caused by the current publishing system.
Please help us with any feedback on the related threads (and adding new):

- [To what extent are paywall journals harming junior researchers?](https://gitlab.com/publishing-reform/discussion/issues/17)
- [Is what happened to Springer's Journal "K-theory" an evidence that Springer does not ensure its journals' preservation?](https://gitlab.com/publishing-reform/discussion/issues/22)
- [Editor accepts paper without waiting from the referee -- quoting Springer's confusing online system](https://gitlab.com/publishing-reform/discussion/issues/29)

## How can this forum save your time?

### Selected participation
You can select discussions threads where you want to participate and get email notifications.
Unlike email lists, where you would receive all the correspondence, 
here you can selectively subscribe to or unsubscribe from any thread.

### Notifications
You are automatically subscribed to any new thread you start or add comments to.
That means, you receive any new comments by email.
However, you can unsubscribe from any thread at any time
by simply clicking the "unsubscribe" link in your notification email.

To inspect or change the subscription status, go to any thread, 
e.g. [this one](https://gitlab.com/publishing-reform/discussion/issues/2),
where on the right panel at the bottom (you might need to scroll)
you see the Notification tab that you can toggle between Subscribe and Unsubscribe.

### Global notification settings
If you would like to recieve notification for evey new thread,
you can [go to the main project page](https://gitlab.com/publishing-reform/discussion)
and click on the "Global" pull-down menu with the bell icon.
The menu is on the very right tab right below the description.
There you can change "Global" to other values,
for instance to "Watch" to receive email notifications for any activity.
You can even selectively customize the settings by choosing the "Custom" option at the bottom of the menu.

See here for more information about Gitlab Notifications: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/workflow/notifications.html#notification-settings

### Email communication

Instead of logging to the project, you can do all the communication by email.
You can start a discussion by email (click the link "Email a new issue to this project" under 
[the list of all threads](https://gitlab.com/publishing-reform/discussion/issues)
or reply to any notification email to add a comment to the discussion.

See here for more information about Email Notifications: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/workflow/notifications.html#gitlab-notification-emails

### Explicit mention
By writing "@" in front of any member username, you can explicitly mention this member in any discussion,
as [in this example](https://gitlab.com/publishing-reform/working-group/issues/1#note_57216096).
The member will automatically receive an email notification, which is less formal than a direct email.
The receiver can then reply directly to the email or click the Gitlab link and comment within the project.
